    </h1>
    <p class="par">
      <strong>Sotheby’s International Realty Affiliates LLC.</strong> and its parent company, <strong>Realogy Corporation</strong> fully support the principles of the Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968), as amended, which generally prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of dwellings, and in other housing-related transactions, based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status (including children under the age of 18 living with parents of legal custodians, pregnant women, and people securing custody of children under the age of 18), and handicap (disability). 
    </p>
    <p class="par">
      In addition, each and every <strong>Sotheby’s International Realty</strong> franchised office is contractually required to comply, in all respects, with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the real estate industry, including without limitation, the requirements imposed by the Fair Housing Act. As an adjunct to the foregoing commitment, both Sotheby’s International Realty Affiliates LLC. and Realogy Corporation actively promote, and are committed to, creating and fostering an environment of diversity throughout their respective organizations and franchise systems, and each views such a concept as a critical component to the on-going success of their business operations.
