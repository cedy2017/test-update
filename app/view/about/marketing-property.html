          <h2>SOCIAL MEDIA</h2>
          <p>Social media is a vital tool in this space for luxury brands to provide up-to-date content to their loyal following as well as to attract new connections. Influential, well-connected buyers like to engage directly with their favorite brands, looking at unique photos, videos and articles with the ability to respond and share the content with their circles. We are not simply “posting” on social media. We are nurturing a highly engaged group of opinion-makers with exclusive content on Facebook, Instagram, WeChat, and LinkedIn. We know that our social content marketing approach works because Facebook is the top referring source of traffic to sothebysrealty.com.</p>
